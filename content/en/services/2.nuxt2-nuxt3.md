I developed several open and closed source [web applications](https://github.com/learntheropes?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"} based on [Nuxt 2](https://v2.nuxt.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/){:target="_blank"} frameworks, often using [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Nuxt i18n](https://v8.i18n.nuxtjs.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Nuxt Auth](https://sidebase.io/nuxt-auth/getting-started){:target="_blank"} modules.  
I'm active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11258206/learntheropes){:target="_blank"} where I'm always open to answer your question.  
If for any reason you prefer a private consultation about your project, feel free to book a 30 minutes slot with me.
